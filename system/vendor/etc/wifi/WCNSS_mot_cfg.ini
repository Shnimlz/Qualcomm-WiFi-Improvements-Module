# GAMING OPTIMIZED WiFi Configuration
# This file allows user to override the qcom defaults for the WLAN Driver
# Optimized for LOW LATENCY and CONNECTION STABILITY for gaming

# ===== GAMING OPTIMIZATION: REDUCE ROAMING =====
# Minimum RSSI value of the candidate AP to consider it as candidate
# for 2G to 5G roam.
# GAMING: Set more conservative to avoid disconnections during gaming
# Default: -70, Gaming: -80 (less roaming)
min_rssi_for_2g_to_5g_roam=-80

# ===== GAMING OPTIMIZATION: STABLE CONNECTION =====
# This is used to control the RSSI threshold for neighbor lookup.
# [ROAM_TRIGGER] LOW RSSI for 2G
# GAMING: Lower value = less roaming = more stable connection
# Default: 78, Gaming: 85 (higher threshold = less roaming)
gNeighborLookupThreshold=85

# ===== GAMING OPTIMIZATION: BACKGROUND SCAN CONTROL =====
# roam_bg_scan_bad_rssi_thresh - RSSI threshold for background roam
# GAMING: More conservative to avoid interruptions during gaming
# Default: -76, Gaming: -80 (less background roaming)
roam_bg_scan_bad_rssi_thresh=-80

# ===== GAMING OPTIMIZATION: 2G TO 5G ROAMING =====
# roam_bad_rssi_thresh_offset_2g - RSSI threshold offset for 2G to 5G roam
# GAMING: Higher offset = less roaming between bands during gaming
# Default: 40, Gaming: 50 (less band switching)
roam_bad_rssi_thresh_offset_2g=50

# ===== GAMING OPTIMIZATION: 5G BAND CONTROL =====
# This ini is used to set the 5G band lookup threshold for roaming.
# GAMING: Reduce 5G roaming to maintain stable connection
# Default: 0, Gaming: 8 (higher offset = less 5G roaming)
lookup_threshold_5g_offset=8

# ===== GAMING OPTIMIZATION: ROAMING SENSITIVITY =====
# This INI is used to decide whether to Roam or not based on RSSI.
# GAMING: Higher difference required before roaming = more stable
# Default: 5, Gaming: 10 (much higher threshold for roaming)
RoamRssiDiff=10

# ===== GAMING OPTIMIZATION: SELF RECOVERY =====
# Enable/disable the host silent recovery
# GAMING: Keep enabled for automatic recovery from issues
# 0: Disabled, 1: Enabled
gEnableSelfRecovery=1

# ===== ADDITIONAL GAMING PARAMETERS =====
# Disable unnecessary scans during active connections
# These parameters reduce latency spikes during gaming

# Reduce scan intervals (if supported by driver)
gPNOScanTimerRepeatValue=60000

# Power save mode - disable for gaming performance
gEnableImps=0
gEnableBmps=0

# Fast roaming settings for emergency situations only
gRoamIntraBand=0
FastRoamEnabled=0
